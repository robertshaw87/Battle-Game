# Battle Game

The Triwizard Tournament is having a dueling event this year! Select a champion and see how they fare!

## Getting Started

Open up the [project link](https://robertshaw87.github.io/Battle-Game/) and you should be able to see the example webpage shown below:

Simply click one of the champions to select your player character. Then you have a choice of which of the remaining champions you want to fight first. Keep in mind that you will slowly build up momentum as you duel, so try to find the weaker opponents first!

If you're not feeling confident about your chances, you can always choose to forfeit the event. 

### Prerequisites

You need to have a modern browser able to handle html5, javascript, and css. 

### Installing

No installation needed! Just open the page in your preferred browser.

## Built With

* Html

* CSS

* [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/) - The scripting language used

* [BootstrapCDN v4.1.0](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/) - The web framework used

* [jQuery v3.3.1](http://jquery.com/) - Java library for DOM and CSS manipulation

* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Font repository

## Challenges

jQuery is already feeling like an essential part of my toolkit now. I had a lot of fun trying to user-proof this game while still maintaining accessibility. In the end, I'm very happy with the look and feel of this.
